# OS Cams (Open Source Cameras)

**Live views along your way.** Public cameras and weather for the place you're headed, or for the whole drive. Works on iPhone and Android in the browser, nothing to install, free, no accounts, no ads.

**Try it: https://oscams.onrender.com**

## What it does

- **Trip mode:** enter a start and a finish and see the cameras along the road in the order you'll pass them, with the forecast for when you'll arrive. "Follow my trip" hides cameras you've already passed.
- **Mountain passes:** open, chains or closed for every Washington pass, plus a replay of the last two hours of each pass camera so you can see snow building up.
- **Places:** ferries (with sailing space), border crossings (with wait times), airports (with FAA delays), airfields, national parks, ski areas, and any town or zip code.
- **Cameras are data, not code.** Adding one is a small JSON file, so you don't need to write any code to help.

Right now it covers Washington State. The design (data files plus small adapters) is meant to grow to other states.

## Help wanted

You don't need to be a programmer. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Easy ways in:

- Report a camera that's dead, mislabeled or in the wrong place.
- Add a camera, place or drive as a data file (no code, checked automatically).
- Pick up a [good first issue](../../labels/good%20first%20issue).

## Run it yourself

```
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173, no keys needed
npm test           # unit tests and the data checks
npm run check      # type check
```

Some live data (WSDOT road reports, ferry sailing space, border waits, weather stations) needs a free WSDOT access code. To use it, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill it in. Everything else works without it.

## How it's built

SvelteKit and TypeScript on one small Node server, deployed on Render. Cameras, places, drives, passes and weather sources live in `data/`, each file checked against a schema in `schema/`. See [docs/data-model.md](docs/data-model.md), [docs/decisions.md](docs/decisions.md) and [docs/sources.md](docs/sources.md) (where each camera feed comes from and why we're allowed to use it).

## About this project

Built in October 2026 by one person with voice dictation and [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), while recovering from surgery. It's a prototype and it's open source, and it would be better with other people in it.
