# Camera data model

Cameras are data, never code. Adding or removing a camera never requires a code change.

Each camera is one JSON file in `data/cameras/`, named `<id>.json`, validated by `schema/camera.schema.json`.

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | yes | Slug, matches filename |
| name | yes | |
| lat, lon | yes | Decimal degrees |
| feed_url | yes | The raw feed |
| feed_type | yes | `image`, `video`, or `stream` |
| source | yes | Operator, e.g. WSDOT |
| status | yes | `pending` or `approved` |
| created_at | yes | ISO 8601 |
| approved_by | if approved | |
| submitted_by | no | |
| page_url | no | Attribution link |
| refresh_seconds | no | For image feeds |

## Approval

The app only shows `approved` cameras. New submissions arrive as `pending`. Approval means changing `status` and setting `approved_by`.

Future submission paths (web form, GitHub PR) write this same format. Not built yet.

## Optional fields

`description`, `elevation_m`, `heading`, `route`, `milepost`, `embed_mode` (`direct`, `iframe`, `proxy`, `link`), `license_or_terms`, `attribution_text`, `tags`.

Tags are free-form labels such as `road`, `mountain`, `summit`, `surf`, `weather`. They are optional and only used for filtering.

## Locations are derived, not stored

A camera does not belong to an area. Search returns every approved camera within a radius of the searched point, so nearby places overlap naturally (a park and a beach next to it can share cameras). There is no `area` field.

## Not stored here

Live health data (last checked, is live) changes constantly and does not belong in git. It will live in a separate store later.

## Seasonal cameras

Some cameras are off for part of the year (ski resort cams in the off-season). Set `availability: seasonal` with `expected_return` (YYYY-MM) and a `seasonal_note`. `feed_url` is then optional, but `page_url` is required so we keep the link in the data.

The app should show these as a clearly labeled placeholder ("not broken, back in November"), not as an error and not as a bare link. When the feed is live, set `availability: live` and add `feed_url`.

`location_precision: approximate` marks coordinates that are a best guess (e.g. the base area) until exact positions are known.

## Weather sources

Conditions are data too. Each file in `data/weather-sources/` (schema: `schema/weather-source.schema.json`) points at one place to get conditions for a location: an NWS forecast, a WSDOT weather station, or WSDOT pass conditions. Search returns nearby weather sources the same way it returns nearby cameras.

The files only say where to look. The app fetches live values at view time. API keys are never stored: `requires_key` names an environment variable (e.g. `WSDOT_CODE`).

Same seasonal rule as cameras: if a source is quiet in the off-season, mark it `seasonal` and show a clear "not broken" placeholder.

NWAC avalanche-center stations (Brooks Chair, Tye Mill/Skyline, Grace Lakes, Berne) are a possible later addition. They publish readings only, no cameras, and we have not confirmed a usable API.

## Provider cameras (Windy.com)

A camera can set `provider: "windy"` and `provider_ref` (the Windy webcam id) instead of `feed_url`. Windy picture links expire, so they are never stored: the server asks Windy for the current link at view time (cached about 5 minutes) and needs `WINDY_API_KEY`.

Windy's terms, which the app follows: show images no larger than the API size, use the API's links unchanged, link every image to its Windy page, and show "Webcams provided by Windy.com" on pages that use them.

To find candidates near a place: `node --env-file=.env scripts/windy-nearby.mjs <lat> <lon> [radius_km]`. Many Windy cameras duplicate WSDOT ones; the script flags those.

## Collections, ferries and border crossings

A collection (`data/collections/`, schema `collection.schema.json`) is a section on the home page that groups related places, such as every ferry terminal. A place joins by setting `collection` to the collection's id; places in a collection are listed on that collection's page (`/collections/<id>`) instead of the main home list.

- **Ferries:** one place per WSF terminal (`ferry-<name>`), each with its WSDOT cameras and a `ferry` weather source (`provider: wsdot-ferry`, `provider_ref` = WSF terminal id) that shows the next sailings and drive-up space.
- **Border crossings:** one place per crossing (`border-<name>`), each with nearby WSDOT cameras and a `border` source (`provider: wsdot-border`, `provider_ref` = comma-separated WSDOT crossing names) that shows wait times by lane. WSDOT reports -1 when a lane has no data.

Both use the WSDOT access code (`WSDOT_CODE`). Places overlap by distance, so a camera near two crossings appears in both.

## Featured drives

Files in `data/drives/` (schema `drive.schema.json`) are ready-made trips shown on the home page under Plan a drive. `from` and `to` can be a town, zip, address, a place id, or `lat,lon` (coordinates skip the place search; set `from_label` to name them). Example: `us2-everett-stevens-pass`.

## Airports

The `airports` collection has one place per airport (`airport-<name>`), each with the WSDOT cameras on the roads in, any airport cameras (via Windy), and three weather sources:
- `faa-status` (kind `airport`): current FAA ground stops, ground delays, arrival and departure delays and closures. The FAA feed lists only airports with a problem, so no entry means "none reported". Notices that only restrict general aviation are ignored.
- `nws-obs` (kind `station`): the airport's own weather station (sky, temperature, visibility, wind). Visibility matters for flights.
- A normal NWS forecast.

Security checkpoint wait times are not included: there is no official open feed, and the third-party estimates found were not reliable.

To add a drive's cameras in one step: `node --env-file=.env scripts/import-wsdot-route.mjs "<from lat,lon>" "<to lat,lon>" [corridor_miles] [tag]`, then add a file in `data/drives/` and a forecast source (`nws-forecast-<place>`) at each end.

## Rivers

A `river` weather source (`provider: nwps`, `provider_ref` = NOAA gauge id such as `SNAW1`) shows the river level now, whether it is rising or falling, the forecast high and where flood stage starts, from NOAA's National Water Prediction Service. Gauges along a drive appear in its weather strip. Find a gauge id with `https://api.water.noaa.gov/nwps/v1/gauges?bbox.xmin=...` (a bounding box around the place).
