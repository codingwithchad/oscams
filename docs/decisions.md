# Decisions

## 2026-10-07: Stack

- **Installable web app (PWA), mobile-first.** No app stores, shareable by link. Car integration (Android Auto / CarPlay) is a possible later add-on; camera images are not expected to be allowed on car screens while driving.
- **TypeScript everywhere, SvelteKit.** One language for pages and server code. Chosen for small, fast pages on weak mountain signal.
- **Single Node server (SvelteKit adapter-node).** Target is about 1,000 users on one small server. Camera and weather files are read into memory, and upstream fetches (WSDOT, NWS) are cached so load on providers stays low.
- **Files in git remain the source of truth** for cameras and weather sources (see data-model.md).
- **Secrets stay in environment variables**, never in the repo.

## 2026-10-07: Trip mode is the differentiator

Windy.com already offers a map of cameras, so OS Cams focuses on the drive: enter From and To, get the cameras (and conditions) along the road in the order you will pass them, stopping at the destination. "Follow my trip" uses the phone's location to hide cameras already passed and show the next one ahead.

- Route comes from the free OSRM demo server (cached). Replace with a paid or self-hosted router before heavy use.
- Corridor 1.5 mi either side of the road, 2 mi buffer past the destination, 2.5 mi radius around the destination for places like resorts that sit off the road.
- Follow mode needs the page open and the screen on (it asks for a screen wake lock). It is meant for passengers and pre-trip checks, not for a driver to study.
